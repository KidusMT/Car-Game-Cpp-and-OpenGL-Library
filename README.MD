			ABOUT THE PROJECT

The graphics project contains about the the rotation of a car in a different translation amount with different objects(polygons) kept in different position around the center.

The red track lines help the user to know where exactly and in which object's target he is in.

I have tried to add the sound for the rain. and it works but the porblem is I haven't made the multi-thread syntax becauce the language was very new and a little bit time takin to get accustomed with. Therefore, inorder to here the sound you can change your volume level up and down and you will hear the (trrrrrrrr...) sound which shows us the sound is being played but it's is being played in the speed of the animated object since it since the playsound() method is called in the animation display function.

the controllers are as follow:
*UP_KEY = speed up the car
*DOWN_KEY = speed down(slow down)
*LEFT_KEY = move to inner track(towards center)
*RIGHT_KEY = move to outer track(away from the center)

	*S = stops the car

NOTE: you need to add the soil.h library in your library inorder to see the image and the texture.

*in the graphics there is a 
	
- Light source and has been implemented well
- I have tried to put an image using external library called "SOIL" but unfortunately I have defined it but couldn't get a result and I don't know why. this is why I wanted to present so that you could show us about the new library called the "SOIL" if you might have time.
